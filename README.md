# Introduction to Machine Learning
NTHU CS 460200; Instructor: Po-Chih Kuo

In this course, we are allowed to use any kind of machine learning techniques, to complete each task.

### HW1: COVID-19 Forecast
Predict the number of new cases for each country based on historical data.
- Technique: Hand-crafted AutoRegression model

### HW2: COVID-19 30-day Mortality Prediction
Predict whether a patient will die based on their hospital data.
- Technique: FCN

### HW3: COVID-19 30-day Mortality Prediction from CXR
Predict whether a patient will die based on their hospital data and their chest X-ray (CXR) images.
- Technique: CNN + FCN

### Final Project: Dcard Article Analysis
Predict the identity (current school) of anonymous users on Dcard, and analyze tags and comments of each article.

In this project, I mainly in charge of school classification model implementation.

- Technique: Transfer learning from pre-trained Chinese BERT
